# Tower Defense Game

Welcome to my Tower Defense Game project! A game made with Unity 3D featuring engaging tower defense gameplay and a colorful low-poly visual style.

Although still a work in progress, I'm excited to share the development journey and showcase my skills in game development.

## Gameplay
The main gameplay is to stop enemy monsters from reaching the exit by making a defense consisting of various towers. Defeating enemies will earn money, and can be used to buy more towers or upgrade existing towers.

## How to Install
At the moment the game is not published, but you can play if you have [Unity](https://unity.com/pt/download) installed on your computer.

This project was made with `Unity version 2022.3.11f1`, but it should work just fine with more recent versions.
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/thiago-souzaf/Tower-Defense-Game.git`
2. Add the folder `Tower Defense` from the cloned repository to your Unity Hub projects list.
3. Open the Unity project.
4. Navigate to the main scene located at `Assets/Scenes/MainMenu.unity`.
5. Press the play button in the Unity Editor to start the game.
